## What is SEC?
SEC is a file format for textual data similar to 
[reStructuredText](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText) 
or [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

The main goal of this format is that the section/subsection order is 
based in indentation level. In the same way as for example 
[Python](http://www.diveintopython.net/getting_to_know_python/indenting_code.html).  

It's really easy to edit SEC files with your favorite text editor or with string editor like [sed](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/).
